These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

 * Install Docker - ([more info](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/));
 * Install Docker Compose - ([more info](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).



## Running microVerum

There are three docker-compose files that allow to automatically start the components of microVerum and a microservices application ([SockShop](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo)) for testing.

Test microVerum with a single agent:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-single-service.yml up
```

Test microVerum with the SockShop app:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-sockshop-verum.yml up
```

Test the SockShop app:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-sockshop.yml up
```

To run the performance tests please install jMeter and load the test cases in `./experiments`. More information [here](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html).
